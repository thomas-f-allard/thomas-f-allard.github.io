<p> Hi! I am a theoretical physicist working at the interface between condensed matter physics and photonics. </p>

<p> Since October 2024, I am a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://members.ifimac.uam.es/parroyohuidobro/">Paloma A. Huidobro's group</a> at the <a href="https://www.ifimac.uam.es/">Universidad Autónoma de Madrid</a>, working on the ERC-funded project <a href="https://members.ifimac.uam.es/parroyohuidobro/erc-timelight/">TIMELIGHT</a> (Time-Varying Nanophotonics for New Regimes of Light-Matter Interactions). Before that, I completed <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-04586338/">my PhD</a> in 2023 at the University of Strasbourg, supervised by <a href="https://www.ipcms.fr/guillaume-weick/">Guillaume Weick</a>, and then stayed there for a year as a temporary lecturer (ATER). </p>

<p> I am broadyly interested in light-matter interactions, particularly exploring exotic wave phenomena that emerge in unconventional media that could be disordered, topological, polaritonic and/or time-varying. </p>
  
<p> Some of the questions I aim to contribute to are: </p>
<ul>
  <li> How does the temporal modulation of a material's response function may influence light-matter interactions?
</li>
  <li> How to formulate a quantum theory of electrodynamics in dispersive as well as in time-varying media, encompassing non-Hermitian and non-reciprocal effects?
</li>
  <li> What are the effects of strong light-matter coupling in disordered or topological materials?
</li>
</ul>
