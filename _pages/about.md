<p> Hi! I am a theoretical physicist working at the interface between condensed matter physics and photonics. I am interested in exotic wave phenomena arising in peculiar media that could be disordered, topological, polaritonic and/or time-varying.</p>

<p> Since October 2024, I am a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://members.ifimac.uam.es/parroyohuidobro/">Paloma A. Huidobro's group</a> at the <a href="https://www.ifimac.uam.es/">Universidad Autónoma de Madrid</a>, working on the ERC-funded project <a href="https://members.ifimac.uam.es/parroyohuidobro/erc-timelight/">TIMELIGHT</a> (Time-Varying Nanophotonics for New Regimes of Light-Matter Interactions). Before that, I completed <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-04586338/">my PhD</a> in 2023 at the University of Strasbourg with <a href="https://www.ipcms.fr/guillaume-weick/">Guillaume Weick</a>, and then stayed there for a year as a temporary lecturer (ATER). </p>
