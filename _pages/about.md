Hi! I am a theoretical physicist working at the interface between condensed matter physics and photonics. I am interested in exotic wave phenomena arising in peculiar media that could be disordered, topological, polaritonic and/or time-varying. Since October 2024 I am a postdoctoral researcher in Paloma A. Huidobro's group at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, working on the ERC-funded project TIMELIGHT (Time-Varying Nanophotonics for New Regimes of Light-Matter Interactions). Before that, I completed my PhD in 2023 at the University of Strasbourg with Guillaume Weick, and then stayed there for a year as a temporary lecturer (ATER).
